Subject: Key Data Quality Findings and Concerns from Analysis 

Good Afternoon (Stakeholder's Name), 

  I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out because I would love to share some
insights on my data analysis work. This can be helpful for strategic planning and 
further data accuracy improvements. When running my queries I encountered data quality
issues such as inconsistent date formats, I found several date fields in different formats.
This inconsistency can impact time-based analysis such as year-over-year growth. Another
issue I encountered was missing values in key fields and duplicate records. In essential 
fields such as FINAL_SALE, there were missing or zero values, which can limit our
ability to understand user spending patterns and brand performance. I detected duplicate 
entries in the transaction records, this could sort our total sales calculations. 
These issues raise questions about how the data is being processed and how it 
is being stored. However, I believe that additional clarity on the data ingestion would 
be helpful to address these inconsistencies. 

  One interesting trend that I have encountered was among our power users.   
Users with older accounts consistently show higher engagement. From this, it shows us
that as users we become more familiar with Fetch's offerings, they engage more, making them 
valuable assets. 

The next step and support needed to make the data more actionable is clarification on data 
collection where it would be helpful to understand how transaction data is processed to 
address missing values and duplicates. Another step is standardization in data format  
where aligning date formats would improve consistency and reduce complexity in time-based 
reportings. Collaborating with the data team would help establish controls for data integrity 
and hopefully be able to fill gaps in data. 

Thank you for your time and attention to these findings. With a few adjustments, I believe 
we can provide deeper insights and stronger recommendations. 

Best Regards,
Andrea Gualpa
